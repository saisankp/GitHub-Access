# GitHub-Access
Using the GitHub API to display data visually to clearly show some aspect of the software engineering process. My goal is to use the <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.mylyn.github/org.eclipse.egit.github.core/2.1.5">The Eclipse EGit GitHub API Core 2.1.5 API
</a> for Java with Maven to make requests to the GitHub API such as getting information about all the repositories of a particular user, storing this information with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database">MongoDB Atlas</a>. This is the requirement for the GitHub API Access.

For metric visualization of this data to measure software engineering, I hope to use a framework such as Vue.js with Node.js to pull the information from my MongoDB Atlas database (which will have been already filled with data with Java!) and visualize it with a Javascript library - that's the plan for now!
